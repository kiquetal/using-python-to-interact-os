#### Testing in python

	Testing is the mechanism to verify the correct behaviour of the program.
	Test can help make cood good greate

	
#### Automated and manual testing

	Manual testing, using several arguments for a specific function.
	
	Automatic testing, check if the return values match the desired result

#### Unit tests

	Used to verify that small isolated parts of program are correct.
	Given a known input the output has the desired result.

	from rearrenge import rearrgenge_name


#### Writing Unit Tests in Python

	module: impoty unittest provides TestCase
	

	class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):
	  test_something=> for testing framework.

	  self.assertEqual()


unittest.main()
	
#### Edge cases

	Some strange inputs for a specific function or logic to be executed.
	

#### Black box vs White Box

	Transparent testing, relies on the test creators

	Black box does know about the intervals.
	Less biased by the code.
	
#### Regression test
	ensure the bug is not reintroduced in the program.

#### Smoke test
	kind of sanity test on the programs.

#### Load test
	
	The system can resist amount of traffic.
#### The try- Except Construcut
