#### Getting ready for Python
   Operating Systems: manage everything on your computer.
   
   Kernel: main core of the operating systems
   
   User Space: everythng outside of the kernel
   
   os = kernel + user space

#### Windows,macos, linux

#### Interpreted vs Compiled Languages

Compiled languages: process to convert code in machine code.
Interpreted languages: execute code directly.



##### __init___

 You need to create a class to be defined as a module.


#### Benefits of Automation

    A tool that can increase your productivity.
    Scalability when more work is addedd to the system, the system
    can grow without problem.
  
     
#### Pitfails

    Is the time and the effort it i'll take to write.
[time_to_automate < (time_to_perfom * amount_of_times_done)]

    
    
#### Reading and writing files

    Interact with file systems, data stored in files, directory or files
    Tree structures.

    Absolute path: /home/user/file.txt
    Relative path: file.txt

    File descriptor: A token,generated by the OS, that allows
    programs to do more operations with the file

    Open-close pattern.

#### Iterating through Files

    Read content file, with python
 
    with open("file.txt") as file:
        for line in file:
            print(line.strip())

    Read file into a list

    with open("file.txt") as file:
        lines = file.readlines()
    
    Writting

    with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
        file.write("Hello World")
